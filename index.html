      <p>In October of 2020, a survey of UtahJS members was conducted through the group's slack channel around the topics of compensation, education, Covid-19, and other issues. Presented here are an analysis of the results, as well as some commentary, and a link to the raw result data.</p>

      <p><em>Tip: For charts with lots of data, hover over (or click) a chart series in the label to see those points highlighted.</em></p>

      <h2 id="demographics">Demographics</h2>
      <h3>I would consider myself a...</h3>
      <p>This year, members were asked to bucket themselves in to job-titles, such as "Junior Developer" or "Engineering Manager"</p>

      <div id="job-titles-chart" class="chart"></div>

      <p>Also, included in the Other category were (with 1 response each):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Architect</li>
        <li>Entrepreneur</li>
        <li>Senior Junior</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How much experience do people have in different roles?</h3>
      <div id="job-titles-experience" class="chart"></div>
      <p>Some observations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Despite the appearance of the chart, there aren't any statstical outliers in the senior category. There's a smooth distribution between 10 and 25 years.</li>
        <li>Title inflation: the highest-experience "junior engineer" has more experience than the lowest-experience "senior engineer." It's my opinion that the first two quartiles of "senior engineer" may not be describing themselves accurately. </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What are the experience levels for all of the survey respondents?</h3>

      <div id="overall-experience" class="chart"></div>

      <h3>Gender of respondents...</h3>

      <p>This year the survey asked about gender, with the option of entering their own response in free-form text.</p>

      <div id="gender" class="chart"></div>

      <p>Other responses included:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Prefer not to say</li>
        <li>Transgender</li>
        <li>Non-binary</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="compensation">Compensation</h2>
      <p>This year, the survey included compensation questions about base pay (cash compensation), liquid equity (stock), non-reoccurring bonuses, pay changes from changing employers, as well as important benefits.</p>

      <h3>Cash Compensation aka Salary</h3>

      <div id="total-comp-with-nones" class="chart"></div>
      <p>Curriously, no "0" responses were entered this year, which usually happens with students, new graduates, or unemployed people responding to the survey.</p>

      <h3>How does compensation change with experience?</h3>
      <div id="total-comp-by-experience" class="chart full"></div>
      <h4>Comparison to previous years</h4>
      <div id="comp-comparison" class="chart full"></div>
      <p>Tip: Hover over each year to highlight them individually</p>

      <h3>Total Comp (sum of salary, bonuses, and equity)</h3>
      <p>68 of 122 respondents (55%) received either a cash bonus, liquid equity, or both</p>
      <p>Comparison: in 2019, 37%  received a bonus or equity.</p>
      <div id="received-non-cash" class="chart"></div>
      <div id="total-comp-by-experience-2" class="chart full"></div>
      <p>For the above chart, values may be higher because equity is typically distributed over a number of years. For example, respondents may have reported to recieve $100,000 equity this year, but it is vested over a 4 year period.</p>
      <p>Of those that did receive equity or a cash bonus, what was it?</p>
      <div id="non-cash-comp" class="chart"></div>

      <h3>How does gender relate to compensation?</h3>
      <div id="salary-by-gender" class="chart full"></div>
      <p>Although there are not many "female" or "other" respondents, it is heartening to see that their salary distribution is near the top of their experience cohort.</p>


      <h3>How does job title relate to compensation?</h3>
      <div id="comp-by-title" class="chart"></div>
      <h2 id="education">Education</h2>
      <h3>What is the distribution of education types?</h3>
      <p>Survey respondents could choose multiple options from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Self Taught</li>
        <li>Bootcamp</li>
        <li>Bachelor's Degree</li>
        <li>Graduate Degree</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="edu-breakdown.png" width="500" alt="education breakdown graphic"/>
      <p>Note: couldn't find a JavaScript powered chart to describe this sort of multiple-select question. So you get my poor photoshop chart for this one!</p>
      <h3>Do different education types have different compensation distributions?</h3>
      <p>In the past, I've usually had a box plot showing the difference in compensation between, say, Bootcamp grads and Bachelor's Degree holders. After seeing several years of data, I now believe that this variation is mostly explained by experience. As time goes on, and the selection bias continues to work against bootcamp grads, I believe those that continue in their career will have comp on-par with their peers.</p>
      <div id="comp-by-edu" class="chart full"></div>
      <h3>What type of degrees do respondents have?</h3>
      <div id="degree-type" class="chart"></div>
      <div id="cs-adjacent-degrees" class="chart"></div>
      <div id="degree-type" class="chart"></div>
      <p>While Computer Science Bachelors and Masters degrees remain the largest type of degree held, as a whole, they are a minority to non-computer-science degree holders.</p>
      <h4>"Other" degrees</h4>
      <ul class="column-list">
        <li>Accounting</li>
          <li>Advertising</li>
          <li>Aerospace Engineering</li>

      <h2 id="location">Location</h2>
      <h3>Where do respondents live?</h3>
      <div id="live-location" class="chart"></div>
      <p>6 Respondents live remotely</p>
      <h3>Where do respondents work?</h3>
      <div id="work-location" class="chart"></div>
      <p>18 Respondents work remotely</p>
      <h3>Utah vs. Remote Salary</h3>
      <div id="utah-vs-remote-pay" class="chart"></div>
      <p>Some observations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Average base salary for local and remote have a very similar distribution. I imagine this will change in the coming years with the growth of remote Silicon Valley (FAANG and others) employment.</li>
        <li>Remote jobs have a much lager spread on equity, which probably makes them very attractive.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>
      <h3>What are common benefits?</h3>
      <p>Respondents were asked about other benefits they thought were particularly good. Most common were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>100% paid health insurance</li>
        <li>Unlimited PTO</li>
        <li>Flexible schedule</li>
        <li>Paid parental leave</li>
        <li>Education stipends & Reimbursements</li>
        <li>401k Matching</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="raises">Raises</h2>
      <h3>How many people received a raise this year?</h3>
      <div id="raise-received" class="chart"></div>

      <h3>How does receiving a raise at your current employer compare with moving to a new employer?</h3>
      <div id="raise-vs-move-box" class="chart"></div>
      <h2 id="covid-19">Covid-19</h2>
      <p>This year I asked some questions specifically about Covid-19 and the changes in work that have happened as a result.</p>
      <h3>My job was affected by Covid-19...</h3>
      <div id="covid-changes" class="chart"></div>
      <p>Of those laid off, 6 found work (all within 1 month) and 4 are still out of work.</p>
      <h3>I'm working from...</h3>
      <div id="working-from" class="chart"></div>
      <h2 id="previous">Previous Years Results</h2>
      <p>This survey was conducted in 2017, 2018, and 2019 with similar questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2019: <a href="https://mdjasper.github.io/utah-js-survey-2019/" target="_blank">https://mdjasper.github.io/utah-js-survey-2019/</a></li>
        <li>2018: <a href="https://mdjasper.github.io/utah-js-pay-data-2018/" target="_blank">https://mdjasper.github.io/utah-js-pay-data-2018/</a></li>
        <li>2017: <a href="https://mdjasper.github.io/utah-js-pay-data/" target="_blank">https://mdjasper.github.io/utah-js-pay-data/</a></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Comparison of response rates</h3>
      <div id="response-rates" class="chart"></div>
      <p>Some meta analysis of the survey: There was some discussion of the lower response rate this year, and it's my belief that people are suffering from Covid-19 fatigue, and are participating less in non-essential communities (like this one).</p>
      <!-- <h2 id="biases">Caveats & Biases</h2>
      <p>Some of my thoughts about this survey, and on ways this survey could be improved</p>
      <h3>Response Numbers</h3>
      <p>There were 208 responses, out of 3000 people in the #general channel (in Slack). This is about 7% of members. For this number of respondents and population size, we could say that we have a 95% confidence level, with a margin of error of about 6%. Not the best, but not the worst either.</p>
      <h3>Self-selection</h3>
      <p>Members of UtahJS self-selected into responding to the survey, and were not randomly sampled. It's not possible to know if there is a segment of UtahJS that was less or more likely to repond. I believe that there is good representation across years of experience, education types, and job titles. However, the representation of women in the survey decreased from last year. I don't know if a smaller percentage of the overall women participated in the survey this year, or perhaps the number of women who participate in UtahJS declined. In either case, the gender representation was not very diverse.</p>
      <h3>Survivorship bias</h3>
      <p>One particular bias that I would be concerned about in survey responses is survivorship bias, especially as it relates to education data. For example, if an individual who attended a bootcamp, and for a short time participated in UtahJS, but for whatever reason stopped participating (couldn't find a job, moved locations, etc), this persons experience would not be captured in the survey results. Or to put another way, the only data we have is for individuals who are successful enough in their careers to continue.</p>
      <p>Because of this bias, we need to be careful about how we understand the survey results. It would not be correct to say that "people who are self-taught make $$ salary," rather "people who are in UtahJS who were self-taught make $$ salary," because those no longer participating aren't here to report their data.</p>
